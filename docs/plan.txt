Functionality:
-receives files from html form posts (I think this uses multipart/mime)
-account creation, login, maybe just "right-to-the-point"
-receive file, generate wave form, stream/play-file back

Things to do:
-figure out how to generate a waveform
-figure out how to clip audio
-roll a media/visualizer player; widget that delegates to an audio object
-add "download" to API so user can retrieve a file
